# ClinicRecall AI – Patient No-Show Prediction

This project is part of a solo internship under Feynn Labs. It demonstrates a machine learning prototype that predicts whether a patient will miss their appointment based on real-world data.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the public [Medical Appointment No-Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) from Kaggle.

## Features Used
- Age, Gender
- Days between scheduling and appointment
- SMS received flag
- Health conditions (diabetes, alcoholism, hypertension)

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~71.5%
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the notebook `ClinicRecall_AI_Model.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
3. Dataset file: `KaggleV2-May-2016.csv` (must be placed in the same directory)
